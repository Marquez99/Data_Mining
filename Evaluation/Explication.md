Implement the Naive Bayes classification model with the Social_Network_Ads.csv data set and using the e1071 library with the naiveBayes () function. Once the classifier is obtained, do the corresponding data visualization analysis.
At the end of the development, explain in detail what the Naive Bayes classification model consists of and also the detailed explanation corresponding to data visualization.


It can be concluded that the Naive Bayes prediction is fulfilled in these events, each of these data are fulfilled and their probability is fulfilled. It may exist in each event of acquisition of articles by the ads, a percentage of error occurs, for which the deviation of naive bayes proposes that these mutually exclusive events can occur.
The amounts of error that occur within each of these independent events are very small, but they occur within this kind of theorem, since to reduce the classification error of noisy data and overcome the problems of probability estimation, we give a novel simple approach based on the maximum occurrence of the number for which the conditional probabilities of any of the attributes are zero for a given instance.
It can be concluded that the majority of people who see ads do not purchase the products that are presented to them, and the amount that they do purchase is very small compared to these, and their error rate is minimal compared to the hard data of each one. of the states.

**NAIVE BAYES**
It is one of the simplest and most powerful algorithms for classification based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence between the predictors. Naive Bayes is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets.

The Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of a particular feature on a class is independent of other features. For example, a loan applicant may or may not be desirable depending on his or her income, past loan and transaction history, age, and location.

Even if these characteristics are interdependent, these characteristics are considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and is therefore considered naive. This assumption is called conditional class independence.
