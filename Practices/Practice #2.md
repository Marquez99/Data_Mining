## FIND 20 FUNCTIONS ON R STUDIO

***Feature # 1***
**Function "ls":** The function simply lists the objects in memory, only their names are shown.


***Feature # 2***
**Mean function:** This function presents an example of how to use the mean function to calculate an average.


***Feature # 3***
**Function "min":** This function within a vector obtains the minimum of a vector.


***Feature # 4***
**Function "range":** It helps us to obtain the range of values ​​of a vector, gives the minimum and maximum.

***Feature # 5***
**Function "seq":** In R we can create sequences of numbers in a simple way. The arguments of this function are:
**from:** starting value of the sequence.
**to:** end value of the sequence, not always reached.
**by:** sequence increment.
**length.out:** desired length of the sequence.


***Feature # 6***
**"Rep" function:** In R we can create repetitions using the rep function. The arguments of this function are:
x: vector with the elements to be repeated.
times: number of times that vector x must be repeated.
length.out: desired length for the resulting vector.
each: number of times each element of x must be repeated.


***Feature # 7*
Function "round (x, digits)":** It is used to round a number according to the indicated digits.


***Feature # 8*
Function "ceiling (x)":** Returns the minimum integer greater than or equal to x.


***Feature # 9*
Function "floor":** Returns the maximum integer less than or equal to x.

***Feature # 10***
**Function "trunc (x)":** Returns the integer part of a number x.


***Feature # 11***
**“Sort and rank” function:** The sort and rank functions are useful to order the elements of a vector or to find out the positions that the elements of a vector would occupy when ordered.


***Feature # 12***
**"Table" function:** The table function is used to build one-way frequency tables. The parameters of the function are:

... space to locate the names of the objects (variables or vectors) for which you want to build the table.
exclude: vector with the levels to remove from the table. If exclude = NULL implies that you want to see NAs, which is equivalent to useNA = 'always'.
**useNA:** instruction of what you want with NAs. There are three possible values ​​for this parameter: 'no' if you don't want to use it, 'ifany' and 'always' if you want to include it.

***Feature # 13***
**“COR” function:** The cor function allows calculating the Pearson, Kendall or Spearman correlation coefficient for two quantitative variables.
The parameters of the function are:

**x, y:** quantitative vectors.
**use:** parameter that indicates what to do when NA records are presented in any of the vectors. 
**The different possibilities are:** everything, all.obs, complete.obs, na.or.complete and pairwise.complete.obs, the default value is everything.
**method:** type of correlation coefficient to be calculated, by default it is pearson, other possible values ​​are kendall and spearman.

***Feature # 14***
**"Beta" function:** The probability density function, dbeta, is used to obtain the height of the curve of a beta distribution and combining it with the curve function the requested density can be drawn.


***Feature # 15***
Function "t.test": The function t.test is used to calculate confidence intervals for the mean and difference of means, with independent and dependent (or paired) samples.

***Feature # 16***
“READ LINE” function: R's basic readline function is used to write a message to the console and request information from the user that can then be used to carry out an operation.

***Feature # 17***
**"WinDialog" function:** The winDialog function of the basic package __utils_ is used to create dialog buttons on Windows only.


***Feature # 18***
**Function "mode and lengt":**. To see the type and length of an object you can use the functions mode and length, respectively

***Feature # 19***
**"Mathematics" function:** Other basic functions widely used in statistics are: sin, cos, tan, asin, aso, atan, atan2, log, logb, log10, exp, sqrt, abs

***Feature # 20***
**Function "as.Date":** This function receives as an argument a date data in character mode and converts it to the Date class.
