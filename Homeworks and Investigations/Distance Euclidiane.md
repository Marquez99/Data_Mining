# Euclidean Distance

**What is the goal of the Euclidean distance for the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) machine learning model?**
  
  R = Euclidean distance is the most widely used distance metric. The k-NN rule classifies each instance according to the majority class among the closest neighbors found in the training set using a function of distance or similarity. When no prior knowledge is available, or even when there is prior knowledge, most implementations of k-NN use the Euclidean distance function (assuming that the instances are represented as input vectors).
  Distance functions like Euclidean ignore any statistical regularity that exists between the attributes of the instances of the training set. The distance function can be adapted in various fields such as classification, computer vision, information retrieval, or bioinformatics, depending on the problem to be solved.
  
  
  **Explain the Euclidean distance equation in your own words?**
    
    R = This equation describes us that the space between two points can be deduced by means of the Pythagorean theorem, that is, the dimensional distance that exists between a dimensional space depends on the existence of Cartesian coordinates, this totally depends on what is the Differentiable manifold, I know what consists of Cartesians where the distance between a point and an inverse point is the minimum set.
