***What is the Origin of the graphs?***

Englishman Joseph Pristley was a philosopher, chemist, physicist, educator, and progressive who was the first to achieve fame and commercial success through being a reader at Warrington Academy.

Joseph designed charts as a visual study for his readings of history. He designed these graphs to better understand the relationship between historical figures, Joseph wrote the dates of birth and death on a graph. The graphs helped the reader better understand the relationship in those historical periods. Because as he said, as soon as you see the names, you see it the first time without the help of arithmetic or not even words and in the best possible way how those lives were related to others.

Known as the first timeline, the new chart used individual horizontal bars on a time bar to visualize life spans. He also invented the use of dots to indicate when someone has not yet died. The sages were so impressed by his invention that they decided to give him his doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. For his book; Chart of Biography, Priestly prepared diagrams showing the lives of 2,000 famous people from 1200 BC to 1750.

  

***What is the grammar of graphs?***

It talks about the spelling, syntax, semantics and even the literary style of a graph, a perspective that we will see that is very useful in the analysis that I will do next to some specific data.

So that there is agreement between the graph and the data type, that is, to take care of the semantics, I have chosen a line graph, which clearly shows the temporal evolution of the three data series and their upward trend. I could have opted for a bar, but as seen in the bottom illustration, the trend is not as obvious and some unwanted optical effects may occur.
