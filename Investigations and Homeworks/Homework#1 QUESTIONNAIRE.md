## QUESTIONNAIRE

#### 1. What is data mining and what is it for?

Data Mining is a set of techniques and technologies that allow exploring large databases, automatically or semi-automatically, in order to find repetitive patterns that explain the behavior of these data. It is a process to detect information from large data sets, as automatically as possible.
Its main purpose is to explore, through the use of different techniques and technologies, huge databases automatically in order to find repetitive patterns, trends or rules that explain the behavior of the data that has been collected over time. Its objective is to find patterns, trends or rules that explain the behavior of the data in a specific context.


#### 2. Where is data mining used?

**Financial data analysis:** It is used in both the banking and finance sectors. The aim is to provide data that ensures that it is possible to carry out systematic analyzes in advanced conditions and with guarantees of reliability.

**Retail industry:** The retail industry collects large amounts of data from sales, customer purchase history, or freight transport. The amount of data collected continues to expand rapidly due to the increased ease, availability, and popularity of web and online transactions.

**Telecommunications industry:** In this sector, data is especially important to achieve a good understanding of the business. They help in the identification of telecommunication patterns, facilitate the detection of fraudulent activities and make it possible to make better use of resources, improving the quality of service.

**Analysis of biological data:** The field of biology is one of the most benefited by advances in technology. Genomics, proteomics, functional genomics and data mining applied to the research of living beings are just a few examples, a list where bioinformatics should not be forgotten.


#### 3. Applications of data mining?

**Commerce and banking:** Customer segmentation, sales forecast, risk analysis.

**Medicine:** Diagnosis of diseases, the effectiveness of treatments, patient monitoring.

**Non-numerical information retrieval:** Text mining, web mining, image, video, voice and text search and identification from multimedia databases.

**Astronomy:** Identification of new stars and galaxies.

**Geology, mining, agriculture and fishing:** Identification of areas of use for different crops or fishing or mining in satellite image databases.

**Environmental Sciences:** Identification of models of functioning of natural and / or artificial ecosystems to improve their observation, management and / or control.

**Social Sciences:** Study of the flows of public opinion. City planning: identifying neighborhoods with conflict based on sociodemographic values, etc.
